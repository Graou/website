I am Margot Neyret, a second year PhD student at University Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris, France) and Institute of Research for Development. I study the interactions between non-cultivated plant communities, farming practices and soil characteristics in Northern Thailand. In particular, I focus on how changes in community structures, led by land-use changes, can affect soil protection from erosion.
