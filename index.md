I am a plant community ecologist. I am  interested in the effects of global changes - either land use or climate change - on the structuration of plant communities, the ecosystem services they provide and more generally on the functioning of ecosystems.  
Besides my experience in plant ecology, I am also interested more generally in the interactions between societies and the environments, both in terms of providing guidance to environmental policies and from an anthropological point of view.

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the[ Causes and Consequences of Biodiversity Change  group](http://www.bik-f.de/root/index.php?page_id=1227) of the Senckenberg  BiK-F in Frankfurt, Germany. My project is part of the [Biodiversity Exploratories](http://www.biodiversity-exploratories.de/1/home/) and aims to determine how landscape composition and configuration affect ecosystem service multifunctionality. 

I conducted my PhD at University Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris, France) and Institute of Research for Development. I studied the interactions between non-cultivated plant communities, farming practices and soil characteristics in Northern Thailand. I investigated the relative effects of landscape, soil and land-use history on plant communities' structure and associated ecosystemic services. In particular, I showed that the expansion of rubber trees plantation into agricultural landscapes affects weed communities composition and  strongly increases soil erosion compared to annual crops.
