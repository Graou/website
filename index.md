I am a plant community ecologist. I am  interested in the effects of global changes - either land use or climate change - on the structuration of plant communities, their ecosystemic services and more generally on the functioning of ecosystems.  
Besides my experience in plant ecology, I also have training in Ethnobotany. I am convinced that combining social and environmental studies is a key element to understand the future of our ecosystems.

I am currently in the third year of my PhD at University Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris, France) and Institute of Research for Development. I study the interactions between non-cultivated plant communities, farming practices and soil characteristics in Northern Thailand. I investigate the relative effects of landscape, soil and land-use history on plant communities' structure and associated ecosystemic services. In particular, I focus on the expansion of rubber trees plantation into agricultural landscapes, and how this afforestation affects weed communities and soil conservation.
