I am a plant community ecologist. I am  interested in the effects of global changes - either land use or climate change - on the structuration of plant communities, their ecosystemic services and more generally on the functionning of ecosystems.  

I am currently in the third year of my PhD at University Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris, France) and Institute of Research for Development. I study the interactions between non-cultivated plant communities, farming practices and soil characteristics in Northern Thailand. I investigate the relative effects of landscape, soil and land-use history on the structure and diversity of plant communities. In particular, I focus on the expansion of rubber trees plantation into agricultural landscapes, and how this afforestation affects weed communities and soil conservation.
